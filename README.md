# USDA SQL Agricultural Production Analysis Project

This project involves working with agricultural datasets sourced from the **United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)** Open Data Portal.
The purpose is to apply SQL to analyze state-wise production data across different agricultural commodities for various years.
